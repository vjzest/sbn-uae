        question: "What exactly are Medical Billing Services and do I really need them?",
        answer: "Medical Billing Services handle the entire process of submitting claims and following up until your practice gets paid. Most practices that outsource billing recover 15–25% more revenue within their first quarter."
    },
    {
        question: "How is SBN different from other billing companies?",
        answer: "Most billing companies process claims and move on. SBN actively monitors every claim, follows up on denials, and provides transparent reporting — with 14+ years of experience and a 98% first-pass acceptance rate."
    },
    {
        question: "What does Revenue Cycle Management include?",
        answer: "Everything: patient eligibility verification, prior authorization, charge entry, coding, claim submission, payment posting, AR follow-up, and denial management — managed end-to-end."
    },
    {
        question: "Is outsourcing billing safe for my patient data?",
        answer: "Absolutely. SBN is fully HIPAA-compliant. All patient data is handled with strict security protocols, encrypted storage, and access controls."
    },
    {
        question: "How quickly are claims submitted?",
        answer: "Within 48 hours of receiving the charge. Every claim goes through our scrubbing process first to catch errors before submission."
    },
    {
        question: "Do you handle old unpaid claims?",
        answer: "Yes. Our AR team works on both current and aging claims — even ones that have been sitting for months. Many practices recover revenue they’d already written off."
    },
    {
        question: "Which specialties do you cover?",
        answer: "Behavioral Health, DME/Orthopedics, Urgent Care, Telehealth, and Multi-Specialty Hospitals — among others. Our team is trained in specialty-specific payer rules."
    },
    {
        question: "How much does it cost?",
        answer: "We offer a complete service package, per-transaction billing starting at $0.75/claim, FTE-based dedicated staff, and fully custom plans. Contact us for a free, no-obligation quote."
    },
    {
        question: "What coding services do you provide?",
        answer: "Our certified coders handle ICD-10, CPT, and HCPCS coding across all specialties — ensuring fewer denials, full reimbursement, and complete payer compliance."
    },
    {
        question: "How do I get started?",
        answer: "Book a free consultation. We’ll review your current billing process, identify revenue gaps, and recommend the right solution — with no pressure and no obligation."
